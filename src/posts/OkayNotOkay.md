Hey folks, Happy Mental Health Day! Here's a lil talk I gave yesterday about how it's okay not to be okay.

Here's a link to [the slides](tinyurl.com/NotOkayOkay2020) if you'd like to read through or use it as a template! 

Hope you have a wonderful Saturday, Happy World Mental Health Day! ðŸ’–

Remember, it's okay not to be okay! 
Aidan :)

(sidenote: I've read the word "okay" so many times that it doesn't look real anymore, isn't it weird that our brains do that?)
