## What’s a Personal User Manual?

A personal user manual (PUM) is a document that allows you to explicitly communicate how you best work, who you are as a human being and provide others advice, ideas and a framework to best interact with you. 
It helps to avoid assumptions and cultural misunderstandings by clarifying how we work as human beings. It may seem weird and robotic at first but in my opinion, it's a great way to connect on a human level and communicate together in the most effective and enjoyable way. 

## My short PUM

> “Aidan is at his best when people give him direction and a goal rather than a set of instructions. He gets easily distracted so is happy for people to send multiple reminders/requests of how things are going. He likes feedback to be direct and not sugar coated. He’s not great at planning/writing things far in advance but performs exceptionally well under pressure. Aidan is comfortable talking about mental health/how you’re feeling. The best way to get in touch with him is via x”

Fun fact: my full PUM is 7 pages long (This is probably too much but I got excited writing it and couldn't stop!)

## Why are Personal User Manuals Important?

We can’t read each other's minds. My idea of fun probably isn't the same as yours!
I have no idea what time you work, what your preferred communication platform is, any other commitments you have, what your likes/dislikes are, what your strengths/weaknesses are, how you best work, what type of feedback you like etc.
Some people like to analyse before talking, others (like me) blurt out the first idea that pops into their heads. Understanding this allows us to create an environment where everyone’s ideas can be shared. Communication is the key to effective personal and work relationships and this acts as a great tool to facilitate those conversations!

Think of it like an extended FAQ for people! :)

You can essentially skip past months/years of trial and error. Rather than making assumptions about how people best work, we can simply ask instead!

## How do I make personal user manual?

Open up a text editor, grab a template from below, and start writing! :)

Tips: Use 3rd person. Make it long enough. Ask for others perspectives. Share it!
